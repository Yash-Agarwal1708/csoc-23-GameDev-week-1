## COPS WEEK Event - Game Development

### Introduction
I had the opportunity to participate in the COPS WEEK event where I showcased a game that I developed. The game I created was something given as a task in week 1 and 2 which was inspired by the popular game Mario. With permission from Yash Bhaiya, I embarked on the development of this exciting game. The source code for the game can be found on GitHub at the following link: [Canyon Crossing](https://github.com/darshi1337/Canyon-Crossing).

### Features

1. Improved Jump Mechanics
   - Enhanced the character's jump action to be snappy and quick for a better gameplay experience.

2. Randomized Enemy Spawner
   - Implemented an enemy spawner that operates in a randomized manner.
   - As the game progresses, the time between enemy spawns decreases, increasing the difficulty level.

3. Infinite Background and Camera System
   - Implemented an infinite background instead of moving the green ball character along the X-axis.
   - Created an illusion of forward movement, while the green ball remains stationary horizontally.
   - The infinite background enhances the immersive experience of the game.

4. Coin Collection and Health System
   - The coin collection is based on the number of enemies successfully evaded.
   - Each collision with a red ball (enemy) results in the green ball losing one heart from its original total of seven hearts.
   - The remaining hearts are displayed in the top-left corner of the screen, along with the score in the top-right corner.

5. Endless Background Implementation
   - Instead of squashing enemies, which is not feasible in an endless runner game, an endless background was implemented.
   - The background continuously scrolls to simulate movement, creating a seamless and engaging gameplay experience.
